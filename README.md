## üöÄ Features

- **Malware Defense**  
  As a first-year cybersecurity student without dedicated servers or a custom detection engine (yet), Nox currently leverages Windows Defender via native CLI commands. This gives you real-time monitoring, signature-based and heuristic scans (quick, full, or custom folder), automatic definition updates, quarantine with safe rollback, and customizable exclusion lists ‚Äî all powered by Defender‚Äôs proven engine and without exposing users to complex settings or relying on external servers. Future releases will introduce my own detection algorithms and a standalone malware engine as my skills and resources grow.


- **System Cleanup**  
  Scan for and remove junk files, temporary data, and unused applications.

- **Scanner**  
  Manual on-demand scans with progress indicator.

- **File Encryption**  
  Encrypt and decrypt files or folders with strong algorithms.

  Manage browser history, cookies, trackers, and telemetry.

- **System Health**  
  One-click update/upgrade of system packages via `winget`; live health logs.
